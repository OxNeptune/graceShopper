# GH1810 Grace Shopper Project: Planet Plant

Planet Plant is a fully functional e-commerce website selling plants that was built over 7-days with Express, Sequelize, React and Redux, along with Webpack, Babel, Axios and Postgres. Authentication was done with OAuth, the design was made with vanilla HTML and CSS (including CSS Grid and Flexbox), and our payment processing was done with Stripe.
