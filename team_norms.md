Establishing Norms


Each group should discuss and provide an answer for the following questions

What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
If two people disagree, then bring in the whole team for an open discussion and vote.
If the whole team is unable to come a conclusion, then team will request project manager(fellow) to mediate and provide any guidance.

What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
Person who is frustrated/exhausted will be encouraged to take a break (walk, get a drink).
If there are any personal issues between team members, member(s) will seek out guidance and assistance from project manager(fellow).

What does this group do when we merge our work together?
One pair program will review the other pair’s work before merging work at the end of the day at 5 pm. If this needs to be changed or there needs to be several merges in one day, group can discuss these updates and vote.

When does this group ask for help?
The person or people who experience the problem first should spend a max of 15 minutes before consulting whole team. The whole team then will work on resolution for another 15 minutes max. At this point, the help ticket will occur if no resolution has been made.

How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
The taskmaster decides pairs at the standup. Switching between navigator and driver will be done at time intervals chosen by the pair. A set timer can be set at the pair’s discretion.

How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
It is not expected to program or work on project after hours (night or weekend). It is allowed to research and brainstorm topics or any bugs related to the project.

What time does this group have daily stand up?
Stand up will occur at the beginning of the allotted time for Grace Shopper.
